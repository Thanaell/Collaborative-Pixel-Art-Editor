# Collaborative Pixel Art Editor

The collaborative pixel art editor is a tool which allows for game development teams and pixel artists to collaborate together and create 32x32 pixel art. The pixel art editor was designed to emphasize the art editor but also allow for chat communication between collaborators. The last pixels edited are highlighted to give each user an awareness of other collaborators. The collaborative pixel art editor was implemented using Qtâ€™s framework and a Gin-gonic (Go) server.
